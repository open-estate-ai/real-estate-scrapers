# real-estate-scrapers

- Collects real estate data from multiple sources.
- Standardizes outputs for ingestion into the data lake.
- Hosts multiple scrapers built with different technologies and deployable to any cloud.
- Will include both reusable scraper templates and actual working scrapers.
- All scraper templates live under: [scraper-templates/](scraper-templates/README.md)


> Note: For now please deploy each scraper from your local machine. Weâ€™re starting simple and keeping things local to avoid linking personal cloud accounts to GitHub and to minimize early security risk until proper automation is in place.
